# Dataprocessing_python

This python program is written to process a csv(test.csv) which contains information about fruits.

From this program I am finding out below:

  1.	Total number of fruits
	2.	Total types of fruits
	3.	The number of each type of fruit in descending order
	4.	The characteristics (size, color, shape, etc.) of each fruit by type
	5.	Have any fruit been in the basket for over 3 days
